Tech Stack
The technology choices prioritize simplicity and efficiency for the MVP:

    Frontend:
        HTML5: Structures the game interface.
        CSS3: Styles the visual presentation for clarity and appeal.
        JavaScript (Vanilla): Handles game logic, state management, and UI interactivity.
    Backend: 
        None for the MVP; all logic is client-side in the browser.
        Optional future addition: Node.js with Express for scalability (e.g., multiplayer).
    Data Storage: 
        In-memory (browser) using JavaScript objects and arrays for the MVP.

This client-side approach minimizes dependencies and speeds up development.
